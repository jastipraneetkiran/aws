# Introduction to the AWS Management Console
The AWS Management Console gives you secure login using your AWS account from your choice of browser. The console gives you flexibility to customize your view and settings and manage favorites for later. You can also use the console to manage and monitor your AWS account.

The console is where you can find and launch AWS services. Use the search box on the navigation bar to find the services that you need. You can also expand the Services menu in the navigation pane that is always present in the console. Just choose Services from any page to see a full list of AWS services.
